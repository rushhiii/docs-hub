# Docs Hub

A centralized, scalable documentation engine for all your projects.

- Powered by Next.js, Nextra, and Tailwind CSS
- Supports multiple project documentation via Git submodules
- Clean, GitBook-like UI with dark mode and search

## How It Works

- Each project owns its own `/docs` folder
- Add project repos as submodules in `/content/<project-name>`
- Docs Hub dynamically renders documentation under `/projects/<project-name>`

## Getting Started

1. Add a project as a submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add <repo-url> content/<project-name>
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Add markdown docs to the project's `/docs` folder
3. Access docs at `/projects/<project-name>`
